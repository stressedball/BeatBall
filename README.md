# BeatBall

Been working on a beatball game.
Pure JS.

Pushes to be made :
- HTML, CSS, JS files

HTML :
- basic 

CSS :
- Some basic styling for now

JS :
- OnLoad :
  - draw platform, ball and tiles
  - get coordinates for each of them
  - add Event Listeners (for keypresses)
  - if keypress is Enter, launch game()
  - game() listens through a setTimeOut loop to the ball coordinates and platform coordinates
  - collisions are coded such as ball gets reflected upon touching platform, top-right-left viewport (bottom is game over)
